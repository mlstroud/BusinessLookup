### API Endpoints v 2.0

| Endpoint Route                          | Method            | API Response                           |

### Version Details
---
As you may have noticed, version 2.0 does not contain all of the endpoints that version 1.0 does.  
Please take care when submitting your API calls that you are using the correct version for the call you are making.  
Attempting to use the wrong version will result in a failed call.  
For example:  
> ...api/1.0/businesses/random  

Will result in a **400 Bad Request** error.  
> ...api/2.0/businesses/3  

Will result in a **404 Not Found** error.

### Querying
---
Version 2.0 supports querying for the default GET route.  
To use this you may enter one or several queries to the API call URL to filter the businesses that are returned.  
Below is a list of queries that may be used for the /api/2.0/businesses route.
> Note in the event of an empty query, it will default to return all businesses. If there are no matching results for your query, you will receive an empty result.

* **name** - Searches for businesses that are an exact match for the name,
* **category** - Searches for businesses that are an exact match for the category.
* **city** - Searches for businesses that are located in the specified city.

To use queries, adhere to the following format:
```
.../api/2.0/businesses?query=QUERYVALUE
```
Replace query with the query of your choice(name, category, city), and QUERYVALUE with the actual term you are looking for.  
To use multiple queries use the following format:
```
.../api/2.0/businesses?queryone=QUERYVALUE&querytwo=QUERYVALUE
```
You may add as many query values as you please, as long as they are valid.

### Making API Calls
---
Use the above endpoints and querying information when formatting your api calls.  
For the purpose of this API as delivered, use the following URL for submitting your API calls:
> https://localhost/api/version/businesses  

Replace version with the version number you are using (reference API Endpoints).  


For **POST** and **PUT** calls, you need to include an object literal in the body of your API call.
Below is the format for the notation you need to create or update a business. Please note all values are required.  
_For how to include this in your API call please refer to the documentation of the software you are using to make API calls as methods may vary._
```
{
  "name": "businessname",
  "category": "businesscategory",
  "description": "businessdescription",
  "address": "businessaddress",
  "openingtime": "businessopeningtime",
  "closingtime": "businessclosingtime"
}
```
> For opening closing time you must use the format HH:MMam / pm **or** H:MMam / pm. It is restricted to 7 characters in length.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
---
> This application requires the .NETCore SDK - [Find your version here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)

      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=YOURDATABASEHERE;uid=YOURUSERNAMEHERE;pwd=YOURPASSWORDHERE;"

6. Apply database migrations.
```
dotnet ef database update
```
7. Run the application with the following command:

dotnet run
```

## Known Bugs
---
* V 2.0 GET route when queried by city has the potential to return incorect information. City is part of the address and query returns businesses where address contains the queried city name.
* Due to a bug with versioning on netcore 2.2, I was unable to get dynamic url version routing to work properly("/api/{v:apiVersion}/[controller]). Current workdaround was to hard code the version paths depending on API version.

## Stretch Goals
---
* Add user authentication.
* Add paginatated responses.
